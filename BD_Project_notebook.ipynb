    "### Function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect GO annotations for each protein of the family_sequences dataset (entity/dbReference type=\"GO\" in the UniProt XML)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this, we did two steps\n",
    "    - First, find the \"direct\" GO annotations of the proteins (i.e. no ancestors, just the ones found in the UniProt XML directly for the current protein id) using fetch_go_annotations()\n",
    "    - Then, we expanded the found GO terms with their ancestors using expand_go_terms_with_ancestors(), which takes all the found GO terms (i.e. their IDs), and based on that parses up the whole ontology tree to find the ancestors of that GO term aswell \n",
    "- TODO : maybe create .csv file here too so we also have the results of this stored\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the enrichment of each term in the dataset compared to GO annotations available in the SwissProt database (you can download the entire SwissProt XML [here](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.xml.gz)). You can use Fisher’ exact test and verify that both two-tails and right-tail P-values (or left-tail depending on how you build the confusion matrix) are close to zero\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this, also multiple steps\n",
    "    - First again parsing, just this time on the entire SwissProtXML using parse_swissprot_go_terms()\n",
    "        - Notice that in this step, we skip over the family proteins such that later on it will be easier to calculate the contingency table\n",
    "          for Fishers exact Test ; for calculating the metrics, we can then simply add these family proteins again \n",
    "    - Then again, expand the GO-terms using expand_go_terms_with_ancestors()\n",
    "    - Now, we could calculate the actual enrichment\n",
    "        - Note that we also use a function to get the actual GO terms from the GO ids using the helper function get_go_terms_given_goid()\n",
    "        - Furthermore, as both our family and full SwissProt Parser created dictionaries of the form protein_id : [go_ids], we also employ a helper function to reverse this dictionary into go_id : [protein_ids], since this structure simplifies the calculations of Fishers Exact Test\n",
    "    - We calculate some additional metrics for the enrichment, see the code (i.e all the things in the .csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Results in enrichment_results.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plot enriched terms in a word cloud \n",
    "    - Plot a word cloud based on the enriched terms, i.e. the ones with two-tail & right tail P-value <0.05\n",
    "    - To weight the terms in the word cloud, we use the proportion of the percentage that GO term had in our dataset to the percentage the GO term had in the entirety of SwissProt  \n",
    "\n",
    "Results in go_enrichment_wordcloud.png\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Take into consideration the hierarchical structure of the GO ontology and report most significantly enriched branches, i.e. high level terms\n",
    "    - For each GO-Id in the family, we parsed up the whole tree such that we found all ancestors of that GO-Id and added an \"enriched child\" to each of these ancestors, i.e. the initial GO-term for the search itself was the enriched child (the \"enrichment\" was weighted by the two-sided p-value we obtained earlier).\n",
    "    - After that, we then printed out the top 20 branches that had atleast 2 enriched children and were somewhere high up in the tree (i.e. not deeper than depth 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Always report the full name of the terms and not only the GO ID"
