\section{Motifs}

To identify conserved short motifs within our protein family, we began by analyzing the locations of intrinsically disordered regions. These regions were predicted using MobiDB-lite~\cite{mobidb}, which combines multiple approaches to consensus disorder prediction. The analysis focused on regions likely to contain functional motifs. We then extracted motif patterns from two widely-used resources: ELM classes~\cite{elm} and ProSite patterns~\cite{prosite}. For ProSite patterns, a script adapted from Stevin Wilson's \texttt{PrositePatternsToPythonRegex}~\cite{stevin_wilson} project was used to convert motif patterns into Python-compatible regular expressions. This enabled efficient motif matching within the disordered regions. Overall, our workflow ensured comprehensive coverage of short linear motifs (SLiMs) known to play roles in protein-protein interactions and regulatory mechanisms. The identified motifs were cataloged for further analysis.
