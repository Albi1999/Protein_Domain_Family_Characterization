\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The domain of a protein is an important part to model, as it can evolve, function and exist independently of the rest of the protein chain~\cite{domain_structure}. Therefore, in this work, we aim to characterize the domain of a \textit{Homo sapiens} protein that is linked to Lipase/Vitellogenin by building a sequence model starting from a single sequence and providing a functional characterization of the entire domain family. This report is structured as follows. In Section II, we describe how we built both a PSSM~\cite{psiblast} and an HMM~\cite{hmmer} model, which are then evaluated in their performance on the protein and residue level against SwissProt~\cite{uniprot} proteins annotated with the 'ground truth' Pfam domain~\cite{pfam} in Section III. Next, we looked at functional and structural properties of the entire protein family, such as taxonomy in Section IV, function in Section V, and finally motifs in Section VI.  In Section VII we report results and a conclusion is provided in Section VII.
